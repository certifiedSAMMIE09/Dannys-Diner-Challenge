# INTRODUCTION
- Hi, I'm Sammie, I have been learning SQL for a while and I stumbled on Danny's Diner 8 weeks SQL challenge, SO I decided to work on it. This project enabled me put to work all that has been learnt overtime. 
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
- Sales
- Menu
- Members 

# SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
- I used PostgreSQL,putting to use clauses like WHERE, LIMIT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOINS, WINDOWS FUNCTION 

# DATA SOURCING
-  For this project I created 3 tables tagged Sales Table,Menu Table,Members Table
 I created a Schema named dannys_diner, You can run the below Script to create these tables too:
 CREATE SCHEMA dannys_diner;
 SET search_path = dannys_diner;

 
Table 1- Sales Table
CREATE TABLE sales (
  "customer_id" VARCHAR(1),
  "order_date" DATE,
  "product_id" INTEGER
);

insert into dannys_diner.sales_table
values     ('A1', '2021-01-01', 1),
	   ('A1', '2021-01-01', 2),
	   ('A1', '2021-01-07', 2),
	   ('A1', '2021-01-10', 3),
	   ('A1', '2021-01-11', 3),
	   ('A1', '2021-01-11', 3),
	   ('B1', '2021-01-01', 2),
	   ('B1', '2021-01-02', 2),
	   ('B1', '2021-01-04', 1),
	   ('B1', '2021-01-11', 1),
	   ('B1', '2021-01-16', 3),
	   ('B1', '2021-02-01', 3),
	   ('C1', '2021-01-01', 3),
	   ('C1', '2021-01-01', 3),
	   ('C1', '2021-01-07', 3);
	   



Table 2 -Menu Table
create table dannys_diner.menu_table 
(
		product_id int,
		product_name varchar(50),
		price int
)


INSERT INTO menu
("product_id", "product_name", "price")
VALUES
  ('1', 'sushi', '10'),
  ('2', 'curry', '15'),
  ('3', 'ramen', '12');


Table 3 - Members Table
create table dannys_diner.members_table 
(
		customer_id varchar(30),
		join_date date
)

insert into dannys_diner.members_table
values 		('A1', '2021-01-07'),
		('B1', '2021-01-09')
